# Copy/Set (rename) track names

This provides two scripts for copying and setting track names to/from clipboard. The scripts support multiple track selections. When copying, the name of each selected track is separated into lines. When setting, each line in the clipboard corresponds to a selected track.

Requirements:

- The SWS extension
- The "Required Function" package on my repository
