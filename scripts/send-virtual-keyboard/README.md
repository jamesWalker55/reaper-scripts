# Force enable send all input to VKB

This script keeps trying to enable the virtual MIDI keybord input and popup until they are both enabled.

## Why?

When setting `Virtual MIDI keyboard: Send all input to VKB` as the SWS startup action, it doesn't work and the option stays as off. Instead, use this script instead and `Virtual MIDI keyboard: Send all input to VKB` will be enabled consistently on Reaper startup.
