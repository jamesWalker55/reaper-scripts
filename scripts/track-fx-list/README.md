# Track FX Menu

This provides a window with a list of FX effects for the selected track. The list can be manipulated through drag and drop, I've tried to make the drag/drop behaviour as similar to Reaper's own drag/drop behaviour as possible, including dragging an FX outside the window and onto the TCP or MCP.

Requirements:

- The "Required Packages" package on my repository
- The "ReaImGui" extension on ReaPack
